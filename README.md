# Alert Chrome Extension for JIRA

This extension can be used as an alerting tool for any new issues per the configured {{filter_id}}. This initially used as a way for engineers to notify each other, or to write on the configured dashboard within the workplace. If you would like to integrate this extension within your workplace and you need some customization, please don't hesitate to contact me.
